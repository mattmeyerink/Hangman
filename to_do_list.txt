To-Do List
1. Possibly add game mode where user enters a word to try to beat computer who
    guesses letters
2. Add in function to determine difficulty from any 

Current Bugs
After a user enters an identical guess, the game will no longer add to the
incorrect guess list. Weird though because it only happens sometimes. Need to
keep watch for this to determine when it happens
