Notes for Hangman Project

1. Want two different game functions. One against a CPU and one against an
entered word.
    The one against a CPU will need a random word generator.
    Several ways to do this. Potentially search for a library containing many
    words, or make an array that has several predetermined phrases and
    use random number generator to pick one.

2. Start page will have the main function. The main function will have three
branches. One for game against CPU, one for game against opponent, one test
suite (To be removed).

3. The game itself will print the gallows with the appropriate amount of body
parts, the guess grid with correct guesses marked, and the guessed letters
that were misses then prompt the user to put in another letter guess.
    Also potentially a written statement with guesses remaining.
